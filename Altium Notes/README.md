Altium Designer Notes
=====================

# Creating Parts
 - Add supplier data into schematic symbol using supplier search.
 - Change mouse settings to match that of kicad.
 - Draw body outline, adding the tolerances in datasheet.
 - Get 3D models from 3d central.
 -  Use layer 29 for assembly drawing. Add indication for pin 1 and add designator.
 - Update schematic symbol after making any needed changed in the symbol.
 - Add snap point for 3D model to accurately place on the foot print.

# Tips
- Single layer mode Shift+S
- In PCB and Foot print scope press Q to change grid from mil to mm.
- Use sch filter and inspector to select objects by type and change properties in selection group.
- Create notes in schematics.
 - Use sch navigator to browse the sch by going through all the nets and make sure its correct.
 - Add pcb and firmware in the schematic.
 - Create custom Title block and custome BOM template. Use parameters for text in title block
 - Change undo/redo stack to 1000 in both schematic and pcb
 - In project options disable rooms.
 - Add notes with colour code and titles in schematic and provide legend on cover page.
 - Use two monitor setup, one with schematic and one with pcb.
 - Enable Tools> Cross select mode
 - Press R while moving component to change modes(AVoid, Push, Ignor)
 - After selecting component in schmatic after Cross probing, the mask in pcb goes away. To fix this, right click on navigator and select "Select Objects".
 - CTRL + Click on net to highlight it. use '[' and ']' change intensity of highlight.
